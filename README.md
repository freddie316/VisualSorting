# Visual Sorting
 Program for visualizing various sorting algorithms
 
 ### Requirements:
 - Python 3.9  
 - numpy
 - scipy
 - matplotlib
 - FFMPEG - https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases
	- Required to compile the generated frames and soudn into a mp4
	- Must be in system PATH so that .bat file can call it
 
 ### How To:
 Down the zip of the repository, unzip, and double click the make_movie.bat. Input what sorting method you want to use and the array size, then sit back and watch as the sorting algorithm runs!
 
 ### Available Methods (Recommended array size):
 - Bubble (N <= 50)
 - Cocktail (N <= 50)
 - Selection (N <= 50)
 - Insertion (N <= 50)
 - Shell (N <= 50)
 - Quick (N <= 100)
 - Merge (N <= 100)
 - Radix (N <= 100)
